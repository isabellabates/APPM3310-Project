# Topic Modeling of Taylor Swift's Lyrics Using SVD and NMF

**Course:** APPM 3310 ‚Äî Matrix Methods  
**Dataset:** Taylor Swift Lyrics (custom CSV feature set)  
**Techniques:** Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

---

## Overview
This project explored the use of **linear algebra techniques** for topic modeling in natural language processing. We analyzed **Taylor Swift‚Äôs lyrics** using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** and **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** to uncover latent structures and themes in her songs.

The work involved both **theoretical derivations** and **practical implementations** in Python. Our final deliverable included a written report, CSV dataset, and Jupyter notebooks.

## Methods
- **Preprocessing**  
  - Lyrics were collected and transformed into a document-term matrix.  
  - Stop words removed; TF-IDF applied for weighting.  

- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**  
  - Reduced high-dimensional term space into latent semantic dimensions.  
  - Compared cosine similarity between songs in reduced topic space.  

- **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**  
  - Factorized the document-term matrix into additive, interpretable topic components.  
  - Extracted the top words per topic to characterize lyrical themes.  

---

## Results
- **SVD** captured broad latent structures but produced abstract, less interpretable components.  
- **NMF** generated more intuitive topics, grouping songs by recurring themes such as:  
  - ‚ù§Ô∏è Love and heartbreak  
  - üåÜ Nostalgia and growing up  
  - üåü Fame and self-reflection  

- Cosine similarity revealed clusters of songs aligned with different **albums/eras**, reflecting lyrical shifts over time.
